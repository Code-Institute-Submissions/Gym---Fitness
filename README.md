## THE GYM & Fitness

Purpose is to design a website with useful information to I'ts users using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
that I have leart from Full Stack Developer Code Institute Course.

I have produced a website for fictious Gym. It is for a small independent gym.

The owners aim of this site is to promote their services and attract customers.
The owner wants that data is managable and presentable in a way to help them achieve their goals.

### UX

.....

### USER STORIES

#### John

John just moved to the new area and is looking for a gym. He is interested in Membership costs, opening times and location.
 - John can find the address, location and membership details on the 'Home Page'. From Home page He can easily acces members page
 to view service users reviews and also click on 'About Us' page o read in detail about the gym.

#### Sarah

Sarah Is Already a member in the gym and her membership is about to end. She is looking to change her current membershit plan to a different plan.
- The phone number of the gym is available on the footer of every page if she wishes to contact the gym.

#### Mark

Mark has heard about the gym from a friend, but want's to know more before he decides to join.
-A members page includes gallery of people using gym and equipment and read reviews from other users.
-This members page can be accesed on right side on top of the page.
Theese pictures and reviews will hopefully give a great impact and make Mark join the Gym.

### FEATURES

#### NAVBAR

- Allow users to navigate to each page of the site. This is the same on each page aside from the active page setting.
I utilized bootstrap navbar components and CSS to construct this.

#### HOME PAGE
- The aim for this page is to attract and keep customers interested. At the top i Inserted Gym picture.
- I added a button link to the Contact form - which includes 14 day trial as a text on it. it has a background color and hover effect to match with the page theme. 
- Below this is Gym Trainer pictures with mouse over scale up effect i created this using CSS.
- Next I added a membership price cards with mouse over effect, scale up effect using CSS.
- By clicking on any price card user can send request to sign up on certain membership plan.
- There is best Value tag on Yearly Membership plan. I have used position property to position it.
- On this page I have made use of the bootstrap grid to allow items to be displayed nicely on differnt devices.
- It is Important that the service user can easily navigate and access neceserry details so i have added
 a location and contact information on the fotter.
- There is 'All You Need To Know' section for users to answer their general queries regarding gym. I used Collapse (accordion) effect from bootstrap.

### Footer 
- It was important for the user to find the information that they are after as quickly as possible and so I have included the location and contact information on footer. which is displayed on bootom of every page.
- it also have social media icons if user want to follow the gym on social networks.

### Features Left to Implement

- Make form function. -Improve Membership Page: Make images display more stylishly and add videos.
- provide timetable on the about us. have the membership plan information available.


### Technologies Used
The site was developed with HTML5 and CSS3 using Github/Gitpod website to code. 
Bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/ was used to create structure, navigation, forms and buttons. 
fontawesome https://fontawesome.com/ was used to create the social media Icons.

### TESTING
https://validator.w3.org/ was used to determine any issues in the code. 
Throughout the developement I was checking my code to see if it performed as I was expecting. 
I mostly used Google Chrome for this. I used the developer tools to check and analyse the view, functionality and user experience in different screen sizes and device simulations.

### Deployment
For this project I have used GitHub pages to deploy the site. when I started to create the site I created a github repository and thoughout the development I have periodically added and commited changes. It is a straight forward process to deploy a GitHub repository to GitHub pages. I Logged in to the git hub website and selected the correct repository 'the-gym'. On the settings tab I scrolled down to the 'GitHub Pages' section. In this section I clicked on the 'source' button and selected 'master branch' as this is where the files I wanted to deploy have been commited to.

As this is a fairly small project with a limited amount of files and content I have only been using the master branch within the github repository. I understand that with more complex sites and data it may be prudent in the future to introduce different branches. Therefore the deployed version of the site is identical to the files located within the repository.

To run locally clone repo directly by passing git clone command, onto the terminal.
