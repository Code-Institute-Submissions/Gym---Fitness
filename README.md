## THE GYM & Fitness

Purpose is to design a website with useful information to I'ts users using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

The owner wants that data is managable and presentable in a way to help them achieve their goals.

### Structure

#### Interaction Design:
User interactions will be intuitive and allow for easy navigation throughout the site. For mobile devices this will use a combination of a collapsed navigation menu and buttons on the home page to encourage user interaction with the rest of the site. For larger devices a fixed top navigation menu will provide clear and easy access to all other pages.

Will allow for the prioritisation of the information to be displayed in a clear and concise manner to make it as easy as possible for the user to read and to quickly find the information that is most relevant to their needs.

Navigation Menu links â€“ Home, Members, About us, Contact were all individually manually tested from each page of the website to ensure the user is directed to the correct page.

Start 14 days trial button was tested manually to ensure they direct the user to the Sign up form.

#### Form Testing:

Tested the submit button with no input fields filled in to ensure the form would not submit without the required fields filled in.

Tested the Email field to ensure the form will not submit if an invalid entry is made in this field.

Tested submitting the form without one of each of the required fields and the form will not submit without all required fields filled in.

https://validator.w3.org/ was used to determine html5 and css3 if any issues in the code.

I mostly used Google Chrome for this. I used the developer tools to check and analyse the view, functionality and user experience in different screen sizes and device simulations.
